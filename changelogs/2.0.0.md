# !! Important !!

This update adds a bit and removes a bit more due to mod updates and *because I felt like it*, and it also removes [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra) and all related mods, **and this may break or even corrupt worlds!**
#### Make sure to remove any instance of Ad Astra content from your world before updating!!
- Make sure to remove any content from these mods, REI should help out:
  - [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra)
  - [Ad-Astra: Giselle Addon](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra-giselle-addon)

This update also increases game difficulty by a substancial amount (especially in PVE scenarios) due to how IFrames are handled and faster attack speeds
